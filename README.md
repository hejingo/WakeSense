# WakeSense
A Sleep Monitoring Alarm System Using Biometric Data

  Waking up at the right or wrong moment during one’s sleep cycle can significantly impact cognitive function, mood, and overall well-being. Traditional alarm clocks operate at fixed times, often disrupting deep sleep and certain REM stages, leading to grogginess. The following research explores the design and effectiveness of a biometric alarm clock that utilizes heart rate sensors to monitor brain activity and determine the ideal wake-up time. By continuously monitoring REM stages through heart rate variability, the system identifies transitions between sleep stages and triggers the alarm during light sleep. To address this problem, I developed a functional prototype of this device, called WakeSense, using an Arduino-based system integrated with a pulse sensor. This design is novel because it emphasizes affordability and accessibility while incorporating real-time biometric monitoring, unlike many high-cost commercial alternatives that rely on multiple sensors or proprietary software. The device demonstrates that effective sleep stage detection can be achieved through minimal hardware, making it a cost-efficient solution for everyday users. The study evaluates various biometric signals, their reliability in detecting sleep phases, and the feasibility of integrating these sensors into a consumer-friendly device. Experimental data is gathered through participants using the Arduino-based prototype called the WakeSense device, assessing the correlation between sensor accuracy and sleep stage predictions. This research also examines the impact of personalized wake-up timing according to REM on users compared to fixed time alarms. This paper aims to contribute to the growing field of sleep technology, particularly by demonstrating how tracking sleep stages can enhance the waking process. The findings may offer insights into future experiments and technology that aim to optimize sleep. Sleep technology, particularly advanced wake-up algorithms, is essential to the future of health optimization. By refining this technology, the following research aims to connect biomedical sciences and consumer applications for the average individual to improve wakefulness and overall sleep quality. One’s quality of sleep is essential in dictating or facilitating the rest of their day, so it is crucial that resources are allocated to the well-being of sleep.
